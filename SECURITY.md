# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Pre-release NuGet versions are not supported and no attempts to fix vulnerability issues will be made. You should NOT use pre-release versions in production applications.
As a general rule of thumb, for now only the latest Major NuGet version will be supported unless stated otherwise.

| Version | Supported          | LTS                |
